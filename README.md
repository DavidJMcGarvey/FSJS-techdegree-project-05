Welcome to the Public API Requests Sudo-Start-Up Employee Web App where you come for the randomly generatored eployee data, but you stay for the fact that it was pulled for the web! 

**BASIC FEATURES**
Using randomly generated user data from the aptly named [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me), this app takes 12 random users and dynamically renders them to page in the form of small cards. If a card is clicked, a modal will pop up with further detail on said employee. From the modal, the user can cycle through employees with the onscreen buttons provided. Then real magic here is that the employee data is **fetched** and processed without causeing blocking behavior. Using Async/Await functions allows us to produce asynchronous JavaScript that resembles synchronous code, adding to the readability of the program. 

  **EXTRA FEATURES**
- Search Functionality
- Modal Toggle
- Style and Structure

Welcome to the Public API Requests Sudo-Start-Up Employee Web App where you come for the randomly generatored eployee data, but you stay for the fact that it was pulled for the web and handled asynchronously! 

**BASIC FEATURES**

Using randomly generated user data from the aptly named [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me), this app takes 12 random users and dynamically renders them to page in the form of small cards. If a card is clicked, a modal will pop up with further detail on that employee. From the modal, the user can cycle through employees with the onscreen left and right buttons. The real magic here is that the employee data is **fetched** and processed without causing blocking behavior. Using Async/Await functions allows us to produce asynchronous JavaScript that resembles synchronous code, adding to the readability of the program. 

  **EXTRA FEATURES**
- Search Functionality
When the app loads, a search field is rendered, along with a search button and a refresh button. If user's are confused about what the icons mean, they need only hover the mouse over the buttons and their respective 'titles' will be shown. 
- Modal Toggle
Once a modal has popped up with infomation on an employee, the user can cycle through the employees while still in this 'modal mode'.
- Style and Structure
Adding upon the supplied project file's CSS, I added some CSS of my own. I added a two tones a light blue to the background and cards. There is also red/orange border added to the profile images on both the card and modal. The modal has a subtly silvery blue for a background.
